# Docker Handbook

What is Docker?

* is lightweight wrapper around single Unit process
* is cheap to start and stop, unlike virtual machines
* takes very little disk space, because it is just reference to layered filesystem image and configurations
* each container has ists own IP address and talk to each other, thanks to Docker server network settings
* is by design for stateless application, where state is externalized to database or external storage
* immutable containers
* small container because it is just reference to layered file system image and some configuration data
* containers run in limited isolation, they can share resources
